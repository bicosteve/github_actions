** Job Data & Outputs ** 
- working with artifacts 
- working with job outputs

** Job Artifacts **
- artifacts are output files or folders 
- typically used for sharing log files, app binaries etc 
- you can save the files and folders created by workflows or jobs 
- you can download them and use them manually
- you can also download them and use them in other jobs 


** Job Outputs ** 
- Outputs are simple values that can be reused in other jobs eg name, text, number etc 
- eg name of file generated in previous build step can be reused somewhere else.
- jobs can produce outputs 


** Dependancy Caching **
- Used to cache dependancies which are reused 
- can be cached across different jobs and across workflows 
- NB: Caching if for ONLY dependancies
