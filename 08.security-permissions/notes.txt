** Workflow Security ** 
- 

** Script Injection ** 
- a value set outside your workfolw that is used in your workflow 
- workflow can be changed from outside 
- use environment variables to defend against script injections
- use official actions instead of writing your scripts 


** Malicious Third Party Actions 
- can perform any kind of logic in the workflow which can steal your secrets or harm your code base 
- you can write your own actions but this is considerable efforts.
- use actions by verified creators. 
- public actions have lowest level of security

** Permission Issues ** 
- avoid overly permissive permissions by having right permission assigned to your workflow 
NB: permissions are managed at job level and workflow level 
NB: for a single job, write them at job level 
- permissions can be read, write, 
** Github Secrets **
- secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN is generated automatically by github for authentication 
- used to prevent anyone to make request to our repos without permission 
- only valid when jobs are running 
- can make request to github api 
- 

** Third party access for other services **
- use open id connect to access third party services 
- github actions request permission from the third party and is only valid for a short time
- it is only valid for the actions to be performed.
- can be done for cloud,dockerhub etc 

NB: Read on Open ID Connect
